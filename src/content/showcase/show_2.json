  "blurb":"Join us for an evening of poetry and astronomy! On October 4th, Backwaters Prize-winning poet Laura Hogan is partnering with the UCLA Planetarium for a special combined poetry reading and planetarium show. Hogan's new collection 'Butterfly Nebula' explores themes of human experience through cosmic phenomena, vividly drawing inspiration from celestial objects including planets, nebulae, supernovae, eclipses, and dark matter. In this special event, Laura will read and discuss a selection of these poems, joined by a UCLA astronomer who will explain the science behind the poetry. The event is free and open to the public, and will include a book giveaway, night sky show, and a Q&A with the author and an astronomer!",
