  "blurb":"While many believe our solar system has been completely plotted out, there are still countless discoveries yet to be made through further exploration of the natural satellites, or moons, of our solar system. I want to start by explaining how moons are formed and then discuss some of the most interesting moons and their properties in our solar system, especially the Galilean moons of Jupiter, Saturns moons titan and Enceladus, and Neptune's moon triton. Come join me to discuss these weird and incredible worlds and the groundbreaking discoveries they may hold.",
